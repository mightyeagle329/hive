## Project Aims

### For Backend

1. Having a single backend that serves both the web client and the mobile app.
2. Backend should be made of `Node.js` with `Express.js`.
3. Database is `MongoDB`.
4. For caching purposes use `Redis`.
5. Code should be scalable from the start.
6. We will use middleware based approach for all the routes.
7. `Factory` design pattern is used for handling the success response and error responses so that a standard template can be maintained over all the routes.
8. We will maintain the API documentation usign `Swagger` and `Swagger UI`.

### For Frontend

1. Web client uses React.js with `create-react-app` and mobile app uses React Native.
2. UI should be responsive for the web client keeping a mobile first approach.
3. For both web and mobile app in the UI utmost priority should be given to accessbility and intuitiveness for all the functionalities of the app resulting in better UX.
